A [librcd](https://github.com/jumpstarter-io/librcd) port of [Johan's paste-server](http://git.espeon.se/jsannemo/paste-server).
Use with the same [client](https://gist.github.com/simonlindholm/5d5d8b4145ed426815ca889f3358eb6c).

Kindof hard to compile at the moment, because it depends on [@jumpstarter-io](https://github.com/jumpstarter-io/)'s not (yet?) open-source Postgres layers, but the source might hopefully be interesting anyway.
